                COC1 focuses on the foundational skills required to install and configure computer systems.
                Students learn about hardware components, operating systems, and essential software applications.
                This level emphasizes hands-on experience, enabling learners to set up functional computer systems
                and understand the basics of system functionality.

                In COC2, the emphasis shifts to networking principles. Students explore how to set up and manage local
                area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). Key topics include network protocols, IP addressing,
                and the configuration of networking devices such as routers and switches. This level is crucial for understanding
                how computer systems communicate and share resources effectively.
