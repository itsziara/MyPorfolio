                    My first contest when I was in first year, this contest was like a fun because
                    we were just going to try out just for the grade but we didn't expect that the try-out
                    we would be included in the actual contest, so we ended up competing and we got 3rd place.

                    <p>This is the second contest I have joined. This time, I was transferred to 
                    section of the second semester, and I didn't have anyone close among my new classmates. 
                    But because of the director's cut contest, I got to meet new people. 
                    because I was chosen as their lead actress because the theme "Who I Am" matched me. 
                    That's why they chose me. We also didn't expect to win the Champion.

                        <p>This is my last contest that I participated in. I only joined this because my friends listed me. 
                        by my friends. I'm just a subscriber in our group, so it's fine with me. 
                        I didn't expect that we would win either. but because of teamwork and 
                        our cooperation, we won the championship.

                My On-the-Job Training (OJT) was a valuable experience that helped me apply what I learned in school 
                to real-world situations. I worked with professionals, learned new skills, 
                and gained confidence in my abilities. This experience prepared me for my future career 
                and taught me the importance of teamwork and dedication. One of my main responsibilities was assisting
                clients with their permits. I learned how to communicate clearly and provide helpful service, ensuring
                that each clientâ€™s needs were met efficiently. This taught me the importance of patience and professionalism in a 
                real office environment.

                During my time at STI Alaminos, I learned a lot about different languages and technologies.
                I gained a strong foundation in programming languages like Java and C# and other languages, which helped me understand how to create software applications
                and web programs. I also learned about database management, which is essential for storing and retrieving data efficiently.
                Additionally, I explored web development, learning how to build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                My education at STI Alaminos also emphasized the importance of teamwork and communication skills.

                My time at STI Alaminos was not just about academics; it was also about building friendships that will last a lifetime.
                I met many amazing people who shared my interests and passions. We supported each other through challenges, celebrated successes, and created unforgettable memories together.
                These friendships taught me the value of collaboration and the importance of having a support system.
                I learned that having friends who share your goals and dreams can make the journey more enjoyable and fulfilling.
